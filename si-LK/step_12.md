## Challenge: extend your world

You can now continue creating your own world! මෙන්න අදහස් කිහිපයක්:

+ Add more coins to your game in different rooms. Can you let some coins be guarded by patrolling enemies?
+ Change your game's backdrops
+ Add sound and music to your game
+ Add more people, enemies, and signs
+ Add red and yellow doors, and special keys to open them
+ Add more rooms to your world

+ You could even add doors in the north and south walls of room 1, so that the player can move between rooms in all four directions. For example, your game can have nine rooms in a 3×3 grid. You can then add `3` to the room number to move down one level.
