Start by creating a `player` sprite that can move around your world.

Pressing the arrow keys should move the `player` sprite around. When the up arrow is pressed, the `player` sprite should move upwards on the Stage in response.

\--- tarea \---

Add this code to the `player` sprite:

![player](images/player.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
    if <key (up arrow v) pressed? > then
        point in direction (0)
        move (4) steps
    end
end
```

Click the flag and then hold down the up arrow. Does the `player` sprite move up?

To move the `player` sprite to the left, you need to add another `if`{:class="block3control"} block with similar code:

![player](images/player.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
    if <key (up arrow v) pressed? > then
        point in direction (0)
        move (4) steps
    end
+   if <key (left arrow v) pressed? > then
        point in direction (-90)
        move (4) steps
    end
end
```

\--- tarea \---

Add more code to your `player` sprite so it can move down and to the right as well. Use the code you already have to help you.

\--- hints \---

\--- hint \---

To move up, you point the `player` sprite in the direction `0` degrees. What do you have to do to move the sprite down?

To move left, you point the sprite in the direction `-90` degrees. What do you have to do to move the sprite right?

\--- /hint \---

\--- hint \---

You need to change these two blocks:

![player](images/player.png)

```blocks3
<key ( v) pressed>

point in direction ()
```

Duplicate the code that makes the `player` sprite move upwards, and change these two blocks to make the sprite move down. Duplicate the code again, and change it to make the sprite move to the right.

\--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here is how your code should look:

![player](images/player.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
    if <key (up arrow v) pressed? > then
        point in direction (0)
        move (4) steps
    end
    if <key (left arrow v) pressed? > then
        point in direction (-90)
        move (4) steps
    end

+    if <key (down arrow v) pressed? > then
        point in direction (180)
        move (4) steps
    end
+    if <key [right arrow v] pressed? > then
        point in direction (90)
        move (4) steps
    end
end
```
