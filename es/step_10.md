## Collecting coins

As your `player` sprite moves through the world, they can collect coins.

+ Add a new variable valled `coins`{:class="blockdata"} to your project.

+ Right-click on the `coin` sprite and choose **show**.

+ Add code to your `coin` sprite so that it only appears in room 1.

+ Add code to your `coin` sprite so that `1` is added to the `coins`{:class="blockdata"} variable once the `player` sprite touches the `coin` sprite to 'pick it up'.
    
    ```blocks
    when flag clicked
    wait until <touching [player v]?>
    change [coins v] by (1)
    stop [other scripts in sprite v]
    hide
```

The code `stop other scripts in sprite`{:class="blockcontrol"} is needed so that the `coin` sprite stops being displayed in room 1 once it's been collected.

+ You'll also need to add code to set your `coins`{:class="blockdata"} variable to `` at the start of your game.

+ Test your project â€” collecting a coin should change your `coins` score to `1`.
