+ Test out your `player` sprite again, and you'll probably notice that they have the ability to walk through the light grey walls.

+ To fix this, you should move the `player` sprite back if they're touching a light grey wall. Here's the code you'll need to add inside your `forever`{:class="blockcontrol"} block below the direction blocks:

```blocks
    if < touching color [#BABABA]? > then
        move (-4) steps
    end
```

+ Test this new code: move the `player` sprite below the wall, and then see whether you can move them up into it. If your code works, this shouldn't be possible.
