## Challenge: extend your world
You can now continue creating your own world! Here are some ideas:

+ Can you add more coins to your game in different rooms?
+ Can you add some coins could even be guarded by patrolling enemies?
+ Change the setting of your game, and change your game graphics
+ Add sound and music to your game
+ Add more people, enemies, signs, and coins
+ Add red and yellow doors, and special keys to open them
+ Add more rooms to your world
+ Add other useful items to your game

+ Use coins to get information from other people:

+ You could even add doors in the north and south walls of room 1, so that the player can move between rooms in all four directions. For example, if you had nine rooms, you could think of them as being in a 3Ã—3 grid. You can then add `3` to the room number to move down one level.
