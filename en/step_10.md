## Collecting coins

As your `player` sprite moves through the world, they can collect coins.

--- task ---
Add a new variable valled `coins`{:class="blockdata"} to your project.
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Right-click on the `coin` sprite and choose **show**.

--- task ---
Add code to your `coin` sprite so that it only appears in room 1.
--- /task ---


--- task ---

Add code to your `coin` sprite so that `1` is added to the `coins`{:class="blockdata"} variable once the `player` sprite touches the `coin` sprite to 'pick it up'.

```blocks
when flag clicked
wait until <touching [player v]?>
change [coins v] by (1)
hide
stop [other scripts in sprite v]
```

The code `stop other scripts in sprite`{:class="blockcontrol"} is needed so that the `coin` sprite stops being displayed in room 1 once it's been collected.

--- task ---
You'll also need to add code to set your `coins`{:class="blockdata"} variable to `0` at the start of your game.
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Test your project â€” collecting a coin should change your `coins` score to `1`.
