## Challenge: add an enemy

You could also add in patrolling enemies. If the player touches an enemy, the game ends.

+ Add code to the `enemy` sprite so that it only appears in room 2.

+ Add code to move the `enemy` sprite, and to end the game if the `enemy` sprite touches the `player` sprite. It's easier to do this in separate code blocks. Here's how your `enemy` sprite code might look:

+ Test out your `enemy` sprite to make sure that:
	+ It's only visible in room 2
	+ It patrols the room
	+ The game ends if the `player` sprite touches it
