## Die Figur vom `Spieler` bewegen

Beginnen wir mit der Programmierung einer `Spieler`-Figur die sich in deiner Welt umher bewegen kann.

The person playing the game will use the arrow keys to move the `player` sprite around. When the person presses the up arrow, you need to tell the `player` sprite to move up in response, so that it moves in the right direction.

+ Add this code to the `player` sprite:

```blocks
    when flag clicked
    forever
        if <key [up arrow v] pressed? > then
            point in direction (0)
            move (4) steps
        end
    end
```

+ Test out your `player` sprite by clicking the flag and then holding down the up arrow. Does your `player` sprite move up?

+ To move the `player` sprite to the left, you need to add another `if`{:class="blockcontrol"} block with similar code to it:

```blocks
    when flag clicked
    forever
        if <key [up arrow v] pressed? > then
            point in direction (0)
            move (4) steps
        end
        if <key [left arrow v] pressed? > then
            point in direction (-90)
            move (4) steps
        end
    end
```

+ Add more code to your `player` sprite so that they can move down and right as well. Use the code you already have to help you.

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- To move up, you pointed the `player` sprite into the direction `0` degrees. What would you have to do to move the sprite down?

To move left, you pointed the sprite in the direction `-90` degrees. What would you have to do to move the sprite right? \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- You will need to change these two blocks:

```blocks
<key [ v] pressed>
```

```blocks
point in direction ()
```

Duplicate the code you have used to go up, but change these two blocks to make the `player` sprite move down. Do the same for moving right. \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here is how your code should look:
